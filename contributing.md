A handful of changes are currently proposed in the Bitcoin Core project and need review. You can find them all linked in the [project tracking issue](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/28794).

The [Kartograf tool](https://github.com/fjahr/kartograf) could use lots of testing and there are plenty of opportunities for improvements, such as performance and test coverage.

For now,  the [asmap-data](https://github.com/fjahr/asmap-data) demo project is the place where you can collaborate with others to create ASMap files and also download ASMap files created by others.

If you would like to report issues or contribute improvements to this website, [please do so on GitHub](https://github.com/fjahr/asmap-website).
